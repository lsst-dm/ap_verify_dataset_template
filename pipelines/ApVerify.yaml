description: Stub instrumented Alert Production pipeline
#
# This pipeline does not depend on the local ApPipe.yaml, because the definition
# of the primary ApVerify.yaml is more likely to change than the data-specific
# overrides, and importing both pipelines can't merge changes to the same task.

imports:
  - location: $AP_VERIFY_DIR/pipelines/LSSTCam-imSim/ApVerify.yaml
tasks:
  # Use the model that's actually in this dataset, regardless of defaults.
  rbClassify:
    class: lsst.meas.transiNet.RBTransiNetTask
    config:
      # Use dataset's model
      file: $AP_VERIFY_DATASET_TEMPLATE_DIR/config/rbClassify.py
